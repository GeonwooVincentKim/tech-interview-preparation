Private vs Public IP (IPv4)
- 1. Networking has two sorts of IPs. IPv4 and IPv6:
  = 1. IPv4: 1.160.10.240
  = 2. IPv6: 3ff3: 1900:4545:3:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf

- 2. In this course, we will only be using IPv4.
- 3. IPv4 is still the most common format used online.
- 4. IPv6 is newer and solves problems for the Internet of Things (IoT).
- 5. IPv4 allows for 3.7 billion different addresses in the public space
  = IPv4: [0-255].[0-255].[0.255].[0-255].

Private vs Public IP (IPv4) Example
- 1. Web Server (Public): 79.216.59.75 (Network connect to `www`)
- 2. Server (Public): 211.139.37.43 (Network connect to `www`)
- 3. Internet Gateway (Public): 149.140.72.10 (Network connect to `www`)
  = Company A Private Network (192.168.0.1/22)
    -> Private IP range

- 4. Internet Gateway (Public): 253.144.139.205 (Network connect to `www`)
  = Company B Private Network (192.168.0.1/22)
    -> Private IP range

Private vs Public IP (IPv4) Fundamental Differences
- 1. Public IP 
  = 1. Public IP means the machine can be identified on the internet (WWW)
  = 2. Must be unique across the whole web (not two machines can have the same public IP)
  = 3. Can be geo-located easily

- 2. Private IP
  = 1. Private IP means the machine can only be identified on a private network only
  = 2. The IP must be unique across the private network
  = 3. However, two different private networks (two companies) can have the same IPs.
  = 4. Machines connect to `WWW` using a NAT + internet gateway (a proxy)
  = 5. Only a specified range of IPs can be used as private IP  

Elastic IPs
- 1. When you stop and then start on an EC2 Instance, it can change its public IP.
- 2. If you need to have a fixed public IP for your instance, you need an Elastic IP.
- 3. An Elastic IP is a public IPv4 IP you own as long as you don't delete it
- 4. You can attach it to one instance at a time

Elastic IP
- 1. With an Elastic IP Address
  = 1. You can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address
  = 2. To another instance in your account.

- 2. You can only have 5 Elastic IPs in your account (you can ask AWS to increase that).
- 3. Overall, try to avoid using Elastic IP.
  = 1. They often reflect poor architectural decisions
  = 2. Instead, use a random public IP and register a DNS name to it
  = 3. Or, as we'll see later, use a Load Balancer and don't use a public IP

Private vs Public IP (IPv4) in AWS EC2 - Hands On
- 1. By default, your EC2 Machine comes with:
  = 1. A private IP for the internal AWS Network
  = 2. A public IP, for the `WWW`

- 2. When we are doing SSH into our EC2 Machines/
  = 1. We can't use a private IP, because we are not on the same network
  = 2. We can only use the public IP

- 3. If your machine is stopped and started, the public IP can change
