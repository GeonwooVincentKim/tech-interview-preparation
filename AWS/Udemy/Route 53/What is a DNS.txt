What is DNS?
- 1. Domain Name System which translates the human friendly hostnames into the machine IP address
- 2. www.google.com => 172.217.18.36
- 3. DNS is the backbone of the Internet
- 4. DNS uses hierarchical naming structure
  = 1. .com
  = 2. example.com
  = 3. www.example.com
  = 4. api.example.com

DNS Terminologies

= 1. URL -> https://api.www.example.com

How DNS Works
- 1. Web Browser - You want to access example.com
  = 1. Send request to Local DNS Server "example.com?"
  = 2. Get responds from Local DNS Server "9.10.11.12"

- 2. Web Server (example.com) (IP: 9.10.11.12)
- 3. Local DNS Server
  = 1. Assigned and Managed by your company or assigned by your ISP dynamically
  = 2. Send request to Root DNS Server "example.com?"
    -> Get responds from Root DNS Server ".com NS 1.2.3.4"

  = 3. Send request to TLD DNS Server (.com) "example.com?"
    -> Get responds from TLD DNS Server "example.com NS 5.6.7.8"

  = 4. Send request to SLD DNS Server (example.com) "example.com?"
    -> Get responds from SLD DNS Server "example.com IP 9.10.11.12"

- 4. Root DNS Server - Managed by ICANN
- 5. TLD DNS Server (.com) - Managed by IANA (Branch of ICANN)
- 6. SLD DNS Server (example.com) - Managed by Domain Register (e.g., Amazon Register, Inc.)
