Amazon Route 53
- 1. A highly available, scalable, fully managed and Authoritative DNS
  = 1. Autoritative = the customer (you) can update the DNS records
  = 2. Example
    -> 1. Client
       => 1. Asking for example.com (Client -> Amazon Route 53)
       => 2. Connect directly into our EC2 Instance

    -> 2. AWS Cloud with EC2 Instance Public IP 54.22.33.44
    -> 3. Amazon Route 53
       => Reply back to the Client that you are looking forward to the IP Address '54.22.33.44'

- 2. Route 53 is also a Domain Register
- 3. Ability to check the health of your resources
- 4. The only AWS service which provides 100% availability SLA
- 5. Why Route 53 -> 53 is a reference to the traditional DNS port
  => Used by DNS Service, hence the name

Route 53 - Records
- 1. How you want to route traffic for a domain
- 2. Each record contains:
  = 1. Domain / subdomain Name - e.g., example.com
  = 2. Record Type - e.g., A or AAAA
  = 3. Value - e.g., 12.34.56.78
  = 4. Routing Policy - how Route 53 responds to queries
  = 5. TTL - amount of time the record cached at DNS Resolvers

- 3. Route 53 supports the following DNS record types:
  = 1. must know -> A / AAAA / CNAME / NS
  = 2. advanced -> CAA / DS / MX / NAPTR / PTR / SOA / TXT / SPF / SRV

Route 53 - Record Types
- 1. A - maps a hostname to IPv4
- 2. AAAA - maps a hostname to IPv6
- 3. CNAME - maps a hostname to another hostname
  = 1. The target is a domain name which must have an A or AAAA record
  = 2. Can't create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace (Zone Apex)
  = 3. Example: you can't create for example.com, but you can create for www.example.com

- 4. NS - Name Servers for the Hosted Zone
  = Control how traffic is routed for a domain

Route 53 - Hosted Zones
- 1. A container for records that define how to route traffic to a domain and its subdomains
- 2. Public Hosted Zones - contains records that specify how to route traffic on the Internet
  = public domain names -> application1.mypublicdomain.com

- 3. Private Hosted Zones - contain records, how you route traffic within one or more VPCs
  = private domain names -> application1.company.internal

- 4. You pay $0.50 per month per hosted zone

Route 53 - Public vs Private Hosted Zones
- 1. Public Hosted Zone (Allows anyone from the internet to query your records)
  = 1. Client
    -> Send request example.com? exist

  = 2. Public Hosted Zone
    -> 1. S3 Bucket
    -> 2. Amazon CloudFront
    -> 3. VPC
       => 1. EC2 Instance (Public IP)
       => 2. Application Load Balancer

- 2. Private Hosted Zone (Only queried from within your private resources, your VPC)
  = 1. VPC (Private Hosted Zone)
    -> 1. DB Instance (db.example.internal) (Private IP)
    -> 2. EC2 Instance (webapp.example.internal) (Private IP)
       => 1. Answer 10.0.0.10 to the EC2 Instance (wedapp.example.internal)
       => 2. Answer 10.0.0.35 to the EC2 Instance (api.example.internal)

    -> 3. EC2 Instance (api.example.internal) (Private IP)

  = 2. EC2 Instance (webapp.example.internal) (Private IP)
    -> 1. Request for api.example.internal to VPC (Private Hosted Zone)
    -> 2. Connect to DB through EC2 Instance (api.example.internal)

  = 3. EC2 Instance (api.example.internal) (Private IP)
    -> 1. Request for db.example.interal? to VPC (Private Hosted Zone)
    -> 2. Connect directly into the DB Instance
