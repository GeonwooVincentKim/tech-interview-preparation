Connection Draining
- 1. Feature naming
  = 1. Connection Draining - for CLB
  = 2. Deregistration Delay - for ALB & NLB

- 2. Time to complete "in-flight requests" while the instance is de-registering or unhealthy
- 3. Stops sending new requests to the EC2 instance which is de-registering
  -> 1. Users
     => 1. Waiting (Users <-> ELB)
     => 2. Shut-down the connections (Users <-> ELB)
     => 3. New Connections (Users <-> ELB)

  -> 2. ELB
     => 1. Waiting for existing conections to complete (ELB <-> EC2 Instance DRAINING)
     => 2. Draining Period (ELB <-> EC2 Instance)
     => 3. New connections established to all other instances

  -> 3. EC2 Instance DRAINING
  -> 4. EC2 Instance
  -> 5. EC2 Instance

- 4. Between 1 to 3,600 seconds (default: 300 seconds)
- 5. Can be disabled (set value to 0)
  = 1. Draining connection parameter to maybe 30 seconds
  = 2. This will allow your EC2 instance to be drained really fast and then be taken offline
    -> Maybe to be replaced

- 6. Set to a low value if your requests are short
