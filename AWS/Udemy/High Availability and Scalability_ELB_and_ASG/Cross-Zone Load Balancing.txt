Cross-Zone Load Balancing
- 1. Example (With Cross Zone Load Balancing)
  = 1. Availability Zone 1
    -> 1. Load Balancer with 2 EC2 instances
    -> 2. Client is accessing AZ1, sending 50% of the traffic to the first ALB instance
    -> 3. Each ELB is going to redirect the traffic across all 10 EC2 instances

  = 2. Availability Zone 2
    -> 1. Load Balancer with 8 EC2 instances
    -> 2. Client is accessing AZ2, sending 50% of the traffic to the other ALB instance
    -> 3. Each ELB is going to redirect the traffic across all 10 EC2 instances

  = 3. With Cross Zone Load Balancing:
    -> Each Load balancer instance distributes enenly across all registered instances in all AZ

- 2. Example (Without Cross Zone Load Balancing)
  = 1. Availability Zone 1
    -> 1. Load Balancer with 2 EC2 instances
    -> 2. Client sends 50% of the traffic to the 1st Availability Zone
    -> 3. 1st ALB instance is going to send the traffic to only the EC2 instances in its region
       => Each Availability Zone is going to get 25% of the traffic overall

  = 2. Availability Zone 2
    -> 1. Load Balancer with 8 EC2 instances
    -> 2. Client sends 50% of the traffic to the 2nd Availability Zone
    -> 3. 2nd ALB instance is going to send the traffic to only the EC2 instance in its region
       => Each Availability Zone is going to get 6.25% of the traffic overall

  = 3. Without Cross Zone Load Balancing
    -> Requests are distributed in the instances of the node of the Elastic Load Balancer
