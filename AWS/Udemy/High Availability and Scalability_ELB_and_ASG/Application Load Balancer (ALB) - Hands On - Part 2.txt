Application Load Balancer (ALB) - Hands On - Part 2
- 1. Load balancers -> DemoALB
- 2. Tap Security, then check Security groups
- 3. Access our EC2 Instances and open the Public IPv4 address on new empty webpage
- 4. In the same time, open Load balancer DNS name on the new empty webpage

How to access my EC2 instance through my load balancer only?
- 1. Click My 3rd Instance and check my Security groups
- 2. Open Security groups through EC2 Instances (My 3rd Instance)
  = Or you can go to Security Groups page directly

- 3. Check launch-wizard-2 and tab Inbound rules
- 4. Edit inbound rules (all)

Edit inbound rules
- 1. Edit the Inbound rules that the Type is HTTP 
  = 1. The only traffic allowed in to our EC2 instance should be traffic from the load balancer
  = 2. Delete it that the Type is HTTP

- 2. Add rule
  = 1. Type is HTTP
  = 2. CIDR blocks scroll down, and find Security Group
  = 3. The security group we want to allow in is the security group of my load balancer
    -> Type demo-sg-load and select it

  = 4. Click Save rules

- 3. If we have a look at our EC2 instance directly, refresh, it's timing out
  = 1. It's not being able to access the instance
  = 2. I'm not allowed to access directly, the instance
  = 3. If you refresh the load balancer (low) can still access my instances
    -> 1. The rule that we haved created in our security group
    -> 2. We allow inbounds coming from the security groupo of the application load balancer

Load Balancer rules
- 1. Load balancers -> DemoALB
- 2. Tab Listeners and rules and access to HTTP:80
- 3. Tab Rules and check my Listener rules
- 4. Check you send everything to my demo-tg-alb (demo-target-group-ALB)

Add rule
- 1. Name and tags -> DemoALBHttpRules
- 2. Define rule conditions
  = 1. Click Add condition button
  = 2. Choose Path, Add into 'Path is' /error, then click Confirm button

- 3. Define rule actions
  = 1. Action types -> Return fixed response
  = 2. Response code -> 404
  = 3. Content-Type -> text/plain
  = 4. Response body - optional -> Not found, custom error!
  = 5. Click next button

- 4. Set rule priority
  = 1. Set priority number as 1
