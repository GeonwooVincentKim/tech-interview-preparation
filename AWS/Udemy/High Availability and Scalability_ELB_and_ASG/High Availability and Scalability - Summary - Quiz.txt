1. Scaling an EC2 instance from r4.large to r4.4large is called
- Verical Scalability

2. Running an application on an Auto Scaling Group that scales the number of EC2 instances in and out is called

- Horizontal Scalability

3. Elastic Load Balancers provide a
- static DNS name we can use in our application
  = 1. Network Load Balancer -> Provides static DNS name and static IP
  = 2. Application Load Balancer -> Provides static DNS name, but it doesn't provide a static IP
  = 3. AWS wants your ELB to be accessbile using a static endpoint
  = 4. Underlying infrastructure that AWS manage changes

4. 
- 1. Running website on 10 EC2 instance fronted by an ELB
- 2. Website always asks User to re-authenticate when they are moving between website pages
- 3. Puzzled it's working just fine on your machine and in the Dev environment with 1 EC2 Instance
- 4. What could be the reason?

= The Elastic Load Balancer does not have Sticky Sessions enabled
  -> 1. ELB Sticky Session feature ensures traffic for the same client
  -> 2. Always redirected to the same target (e.g., EC2 instance)
  -> 3. This helps that the client does not lose his session data

5.
- 1. ALB to distribute to your website hosted on EC2 instances
- 2. Website only sees traffic coming from private IPv4 addresses, ALB's IP addresses
- 3. What should you do to get the IP address of clients connected to your website?

= Modify your website's backend to get the client IP address from the X-Forwarded-For header

6.
- 1. Hosted an application on a set of EC2 instances fronted by an ELB
- 2. Application just doesn't work, found some EC2 instances crash from time to time
- 3. Protect users from connecting to the EC2 instances that are crashing?

= Enable ELB Health Checks

7.
- 1. Solutions Architect for a company, required to design an architecture for a high-performance
- 2. Low-latency application that will receive millions of requests per second
- 3. Which type of ELB should you choose?

= Network Load Balancer

8. ALB supports the following protocols, EXCEPT:
- TCP

9. ALB can route traffic to different Target Groups based on the following, EXCEPT:
- Client's Location (Geography)
  = ALB can route traffic to different Target Grousp based on
    -> URL Path, Hostname, HTTP Headers, Query Strings

10. Registered targets in a Target Groups for an ALB can be one of the following, EXCEPT:
- Network Load Balancer

11. 
- 1. Compliance purposess, expose a fixed static IP address to your end-users
- 2. Write firewall rules that will be stable and approved by regulators
- 3. What type of ELB would you choose?

= Network Load Balancer
  -> 1. One static IP address per Availability Zones, can attach an Elastic IP address to it
  -> 2. ALB and CLB have a static DNS name

12.
- 1. Create a custom-application based cookie in your ALB
- 2. Which following you can use as a cookie name?

= APPUSERC	
  -> Following cookie names are reserved by the ELB
     => AWSALB, AWSALBAPP, AWSALBTG

13. 
- 1. NLB distributes traffic across a set of EC2 instances in us-east-1
- 2. 2 EC2 instances in us-ease-1b AZ and 5 EC2 instances in us-east-1e AZ
- 3. CPU uilization is higher in the EC2 instances in us-east-1b AZ
- 4. Traffic is equally distributed across the two AZs. How would you solve this problem?

= Enable Cross-Zone Load Balancing

14. Which feature in Both ALB and NLB allows you to load multiple SSL certificates on one listener?
- Server Name Indication (SNI)

15.
- 1. ALB that is configured to redirect traffic to 3 Target Groups based on following hostnames
- 2. users.example.com, api.external.example.com, and checkout.example.com
- 3. Configure HTTPS for each of these hostnames. How do you configure the ALB to make his work?

= Use Server Name Indication (SNI)
  -> https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-application-load-balancer-sni/

16.
- 1. An application hosted on a set of EC2 instances managed by an Auto Scaling Group
- 2. Both desired and maximum capacity to 3. Also, you have created a CloudWatch Alarm
- 3. Scale out out your ASG when CPU Utilization reaches 60%
- 4. App suddenly received huge traffic and is now running at 80% CPU Utilization, What will happen?

= Nothing
  -> Auto Scaling Group can't go over the maximum capacity (you configured) during scale-out events

17.
- 1. Auto Scaling Group fronted by an ALB
- 2. ASG to use ALB Health Checks, then one EC2 instance has just been reported unhealthy
- 3. What will happen to the EC2 instance?

= The ASG will terminate the EC2 instance

18. ASG based on the number of requests per minute your application makes to your DB
- Create a CloudWatch custom metric then create a CloudWatch Alarm on his metric to scale your ASG

19.
- 1. An application is deployed with an ALB and an Auto Scaling Group
- 2. You manually scale the ASG and you would like to define a Scaling Policy
- 3. Ensure the average number of connections to your EC2 instances is around 1000
- 4. Which Scaling Policy should you use?

= Target Tracking Policy

20.
- 1. ASG and NLB, ASG supports the HTTP protocol, integrated with the LB health checks
- 2. TCP Health checks, you'd like to migrate to using HTTP health checks, what do you do?

= Migrate the helath check to HTTP
  -> NLB supports HTTP health checks as well as TCP and HTTPS

21.
- 1. Website hosted in EC2 instance in an ASG fronted by an ALB
- 2. Website is served over HTTP, and you've been tasked to configure it to use HTTPS
- 3. Certificate in ACM and attached it to the ALB
- 4. What you can do to force users to access the website using HTTPS instead of HTTP?

= Configure the ALB to redirect HTTP to HTTPS
