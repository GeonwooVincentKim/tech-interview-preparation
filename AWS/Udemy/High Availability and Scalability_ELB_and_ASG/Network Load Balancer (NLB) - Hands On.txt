Network Load Balancer (NLB) - Hands On
- 1. Load Balancer
- 2. Network Load Balancer
- 3. Create Network Load Balancer
  = 1. Basic Configuration
    -> 1. Load Balancer name - Demo
    -> 2. Scheme - Internet-facing
    -> 3. IP address type - IPv4

  = 2. Network mapping
    -> 1. VPC - Choose the default selected value
    -> 2. Mappings
       => 1. ap-northeast-2a (apne2-az1)
       => 2. ap-northeast-2b (apne2-az2)
       => 3. ap-northeast-2c (apne2-az3)
       => 4. ap-northeast-2d (apne2-az4)
       => 5. Can either choose a IP address assigned by AWS, going to be public
          -- 1. Chose Scheme = Internet-facing
	  -- 2. Elastic IP exist = Can select 'Use an Elastic IP address', Replace using NLB

   = 3. Listeners and routing
     -> 1. Create target group
     -> 2. 


Create target group
- 1. Specifiy group details
  = 1. Basic configuration
    -> 1. Choose a target type = Instances
    -> 2. Target group name = demo-tg-nlb
    -> 3. Protocol & Port = TCP & 80
    -> 4. VPC = Do not change anything, just choose the default ont that already selected

  = 2. Health checks
    -> 1. Health check protocol (choose HTTP)
       => 1. TCP
       => 2. HTTP
          -- 1. If we know have an HTTP application, it's ok to use
          -- 2. HTTP type of protoocl for the health check

       => 3. HTTPS

    -> 2. Health check path - Type "/"


  = 3. Advanced health check settings
    -> 1. Port - Traffic port
    -> 2. Healthy threshold - 2
    -> 3. Unhealthy threshold - 2
    -> 4. Timeout - 2
    -> 5. Interval - 5
    -> 6. Success codes - 200-399
