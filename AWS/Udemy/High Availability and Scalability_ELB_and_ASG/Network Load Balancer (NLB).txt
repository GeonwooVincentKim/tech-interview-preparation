Network Load Balancer (v2)
- 1. Network load balancers (Layer 4) allow to:
  = 1. ForwardTCP & UDP traffic to your instances
  = 2. Handle millions of request per seconds
  = 3. Less latency ~ 100 ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)

- 2. NLB ahs one stastic Ip per A, and supports assigning Elastic IP
  = 1. Helpful for whitelisting specific IP
  = 2. Expost your application with a set of static IPs and this can be Elastic IPs

- 3. NLB are used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic
- 4. Not included in the AWS free tier

Network Load Balancer - Target Groups
- 1. EC2 Instances
  = Target Group (EC2 Instances)
    -> Network Load Balancer
       => 1. i-1234567890abcdef0
       => 2. i-1234567890abcdef0

- 2. IP Addresses - must be private IPs
  = Target Group (IP Addresses)
    -> Network Load Balancer
       => 1. 192.168.1.118 (EC2 instance)
       => 2. 10.0.4.21 (Private IP of a server)

- 3. Application Load Balancer
  = Network Load Balancer
    -> Target Group
       => Target Group (Application Load Balancer)

- 4. Health Checks support the TCP, HTTP and HTTPS Protocols
