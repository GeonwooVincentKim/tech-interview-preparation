Application Load Balancer (ALB) - Hands On - Part 1
- 1. Launch Instance
  = 1. Key pair (login) -> Proceed without a key pair
  = 2. Network settings -> Set Common security groups as `launch-wizard-2` group
    -> Which allowed us to do HTTP traffic and SSH traffic into our EC2 instance

  = 3. Advanced details User data - optional
    -> Copy and paste the ec2-user-data.sh code

  = 4. Summary number of instance => 2

- 2. Rename the second instance
  = 1. Check the instance you want to change and hover on the Name Attribute field
  = 2. Rename as My 3-2nd Instance

Only one URL and 2 EC2 instances (Balance the load between them)
- 1. Load balancers
  = 1. Click the Create load balancer button
  = 2. Can choose different types
    -> 1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
    -> 2. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
    -> 3. Gateway Load Balancer (GLB)
    -> 4. Classic Load Balancer (CLB)

  = 3. Create Application Load Balancer
    -> 1. Basic configuration
       => 1. Load balancer name - DemoALB
       => 2. Scheme = Internet-facing
       => 3. IP address type = IPv4

    -> 2. Network mapping
       => 1. Decide where to deploy the load balancer and how many availability zones
       => 2. Deploy all of AZ in the mappings

    -> 3. Security groups
       => 1. Create new security group
       => 2. Choose my demo-sg-load-balancer

    -> 4. Listeners and routing
       => 1. 

- 2. Create new security group
  = 1. Basic details
    -> 1. Name: demo-sg-load-balancer
    -> 2. Description: Allow HTTP into ALB
    -> 3. VPC: Don't edit anything

  = 2. Inbound rules
    -> 1. Add rule
    -> 2. Type = HTTP
    -> 3. Source = Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)

  = 3. Outbound rules (Don't need to create a new one)
    -> 1. Type = All traffic
    -> 2. Destination = Custom (0.0.0.0/0)
