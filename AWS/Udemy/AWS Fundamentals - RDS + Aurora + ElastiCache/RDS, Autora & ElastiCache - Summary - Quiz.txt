1. Amazon RDS supports the following databases, EXCEPT:
-> MongoDB
   => Supports MySQl, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, MS-SQL Server, Amazon Aurora

2. New solution that requires a MySQL db, in cases of disaster in one of the AZ, what should you use?
-> Enable Multi-AZ
   => Multi-AZ helps when you plan a disaster recovery for an entire AZ going down

3. RDS DB, demand of requests from our website, Which solution is NOT adapted to this problem?
-> RDS Multi-AZ
   => ElastiCache and RDS Read Replicas do indeed help with scaling reads

4. Set up read replicas on your RDS DB, users are complaining, What is a possible cause for this?
-> Read Replicas have Asynchronous Replication, therefore it's likely your users will only read Eventual Consistency

5. Which RDS (NOT Aurora) feature when used does not require you to change the SQL connection string?
-> Multi-AZ
   => Keeps the same connection string regardless of which database is up

6.
- 1. Application running on a fleet of EC2 instanceds managed by an ASG behind an ALB
- 2. Log back in and you don't want to enable Sticky Sessions on your ALB
- 3. As you fear it will overload some EC2 instances. What should you do?

= Store session data in ElastiCache
  -> 1. Storing Session Data in ElastiCache is a common pattern to ensuring different EC2 instances
  -> 2. Can retrieve your user's state if needed

7.
- 1. An analytics application, performing its queries against your main production RDS DB
- 2. Queries run at any time of the day and slow down the RDS DB, improve the users's experience?

= Setup a Read Replica
  -> 1. Help as your analytics application can now perform queries against it
  -> 2. These queries won't impact the main production RDS DB

8. 
- 1. Ensure you have a replica of your DB available in another AWS Region
- 2. If a disaster happens to your main AWS Region
- 3. Which DB do you recommend to implement this easily?

= Aurora Global DB
  -> Allows you to have an Aurora Replica in another AWS region, with up to 5 secondary regions

9. Enhance the security of your ElastiCache Redis Cluster, using their IAM Identities?
-> Using IAM Authentication

10.
- 1. Production Node.js application that is using RDS MySQL 5.6 as its DB
- 2. Java will perform some heavy analytics workload to create a dashboard on a regular hourly basis
- 3. Most cost-effective solution you can implement to minimize disruption for the main application?

= Create a Read Replica in a different AZ and run the analytics workload on the replica DB

11.
- 1. Create a disaster recovery strategy for your RDS PostgreSQL DB
- 2. Both read and write workloads in another AWS region
- 3. The DR DB must be highly available. What do you recommend?

= Create a Read Replica in a differetn region and enable Multi-AZ on the Read Replica

12.
- 1. You have migrated the MySQL DB from on-premises to RDS
- 2. A lot of application and developers interacting with your DB
- 3. IAM user in the company's AWS account, access to developers to the MySQL RDS DB instance
- 4. Instead of creating a DB user for each one?

= Enable IAM DB Authentication

13. Which of the following statement is true, replication in both RDS Read Replicas and Multi-AZ?
- Read Replica uses Asynchronous Replication and Multi-AZ uses Synchronous Replication

14. How do you unencrypted RDS DB instance?
- 1. Create a snapshot of the unencrypted RDS DB instance
- 2. Copy the snapshot and tick "Enable encryption"
- 3. Then restore the RDS DB instance from the encrypted snapshot

15. For your RDS database, you can have up to ... Read Replicas
- 15

16. Which RDS DB technoloy does NOT support IAM DB Authentication?
- Oracle

17. Unencrypted RDS DB instance, Want to create Read Replicas, RDS Read Replicas to be encrypted?
- No -> You can't create encrypted Read Replicas from an unencrypted RDS DB instance

18.
- 1. Running in production is using an Aurora Cluster as its DB
- 2. Scaled-down application with the ability to perform some heavy workload on a need-basis
- 3. Most of the time, the application will be unused, minimizing costs, What do you suggest?

= Use Aurora Serverless

19. How many Aurora Read Replicas can you have in a single Aurora DB Cluster?
- 15

20. Amazon Aurora supports both .... DBs
- MySQL and PostgreSQL

21.
- 1. Solution Architect for a gaming company, real-time based on their score
- 2. Implement an effective and highly available solution to create gaming dashboard
- 3. What should you use?

= Use ElastiCache for Redis - Sorted Sets

22. Full customization of an Oracle DB on AWS. benefit from using the AWS services, recommendation?
- RDS Custom for Oracle

23. Store long-term backups for your Aurora DB for disaster recovery and audit purposes, recommend?
- Perform on Demand Backups

24. 
- 1. Perform a suite of read and write tests against your production Aurora DB
- 2. Access to production data as soon as possible. What do you advise?

= Use the Aurora Cloning feature

25.
- 1. 100 EC2 instances connected to your RDS DB, maintenance of the DB
- 2. All your applications take a lot of time to reconnect to RDS, due to poor application Logic
- 3. How you improve this?

= Use an RDS Proxy
  -> This reduces the failover time by up to 66 % and keeps connection actives for your applications
