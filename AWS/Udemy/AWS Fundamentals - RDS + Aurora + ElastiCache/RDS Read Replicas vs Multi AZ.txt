RDS Read Replicas for read scalability
- 1. Read Replicas as the name indicates help you to scale your reads
  = Application, RDS DB instance (Master)
    -> Application performs reads (RDS -> App) and writes (App -> RDS) to our DB instances
  
- 2. Up to 15 Read Replicas
- 3. Within AZ, Cross Az or Cross Region
  = Application, RDS DB instance read replica
    -> 1. RDS DB instance (Master) ASYNC replication to the each RDS DB instance read replica
    -> 2. Application reads from the RDS DB instance read replica
       -> Before they had the chance to replicate the data, then you get all data

- 4. Replication in ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent
- 5. Replicas can be promoted to their own DB
- 6. Applications must update the connection string to leverage read replicas

RDS Read Replicas - Use Cases
- 1. You have a production DB that is taking on normal load
  = 1. Production Application, RDS DB instance (Master)
    -> 1. Production DB is having read and writes to our main RDS DB instance (Same Region, Free)
    -> 2. RDS is a managed service, and they give you that traffic for free

  = 2. Region/AZ us-east-1a, Region/AZ eu-west-1b
    -> 1. us-east-1a -> RDS DB instance (Master)
    -> 2. eu-west-1b -> RDS DB instance read replica
    -> 3. us-east-1b => eu-wesb-1b
       => ASYNC Replication, Cross-Region, Money

- 2. You want to run a reporting application to run some analytics
  = 1. Create a Read Replica to run the new workload there
  = 2. Asynchronous, a replication that happens between your main RDS DB instance
    -> RDS DB instance (Master) => RDS DB instance read replicas <ASYNC replication>

- 3. You create a Read Replica to run the new workload there
- 4. The production application is unaffected
- 5. Read replicas are used for SELECT (=read) only kind of statements
  -> Not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

RDS Read Replicas - Network Cost
- 1. In AWS there's a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another
- 2. For RDS Read Replicas within the same region, you don't pay that fee
  = 1. Same Region, Different A, us-east-1a, us-east-1b
  = 2. RDS DB instance in us-east-1a, and then a Read Replication
  = 3. RDS DB instande read replicat in us-east-1b

RDS Multi Az (Disaster Recovery)
- 1. Application, RDS Master DB instance (AZ A), RDS DB instance standby (AZ B)
  = 1. Application performs the reads (RDS Master DB -> App) and write (App -> RDS Master DB)
  = 2. SYNC replication from RDS Master DB instance (AZ A) -> RDS Master DB instance standby (AZ B)

- 2. SYNC replication
- 3. One DNS name - automatic app failover to standby
  = 1. Your application talks to one DNS name
  = 2. In case there is a problem with the Master, there will be an automatic failover, one DNS name

- 4. Increase availability
- 5. Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure
- 6. No manual intervention in apps
- 7. Not used for scaling
  = Standby DB is just for standby, No one cannot read, or write to it, just here as a failover

- 8. Note: The Read Replicas be setup as Multi AZ for Disaster Recovery (DR)
