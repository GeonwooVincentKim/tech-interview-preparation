  = 4. Maximum storage threshold -> 1000 GiB

- 7. Connectivity
  = 1. Don't connect to an EC2 compute resource
    -> Choose this to test how RDS DB works

  = 2. Connect to an EC2 compute resource
    -> You don't have to handle security groups, for beginner

  = 3. Virtual private cloud (VPC), DB subnet group -> Set as default one
  = 4. Public access -> Yes, I want to access this DB from my own computer

  = 2. Enable automated backups (Automated checked)
  = 3. Backup retention period (0 ~ 35 days)

Amazon RDS SQL with SQL electrons (SQL Clients)
- 1. Download sql electron
  = Download GUI -> sqlectron-1.38.0-win.7z

- 2. Check RDS SQL database-1
  = 1. Connectivity & security
    -> Check Endpoint and Port

  = 2. VPC security groups
    -> 1. Security Groups
    -> 2. Inbound rules (Tab)

  = 3. Edit inbound rules (Necessary to modify this security group)
    -> Set as Anywhere-IPv4

- 3. Connect Endpoint using SQL Electron
  = 1. Add -> Server Information
  = 2. Name -> RDSDemo, Database Type -> MySQL
  = 3. Server Address -> Copy & past from Endpoint
  = 4. User -> admin, Password (Input)
  = 5. Initial Database / Keyspace -> mydb
  = 6. Click Test button, check Connection Test (Successfully connected)
    -> If is red
       => 1. Have a look whether or not your DB was set to be a public DB
       => 2. Have a look at your security group settings to make sure that your IP is allowed in

  = 7. Click Save button and Connect it

- 4. Test with query
  = 1. CREATE TABLE mytable (name VARCHAR(20), first_name VARCHAR(29));
    -> Then execute

  = 2. SELECT * FROM 'mytable' LIMIT 1000 (Or SELECT * FROM 'mytable')
    -> Then execute

  = 3. INSERT INTO `mytable` (`name`, `first_name`) 
       VALUES ("YourName", "YourFirstName");

    -> Then execute

  = 4. SELECT * FROM 'mytable' LIMIT 1000
    -> Then execute
