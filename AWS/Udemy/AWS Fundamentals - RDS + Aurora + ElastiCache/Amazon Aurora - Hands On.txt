Amazon Aurora - Hands On
- 1. RDS - Create database
- 2. Aurora (MySQL Compatible)

<Just pass No.3 ~ No.5 if you want to set as Default version>
- 3. Show versions that support the global database feature
  = Show the list of Global Aurora DB

- 4. Show versions that support the parallet query feature
  = Show the list of Parellel query feature

- 5. Show versions that support Serverless v2
  = Show the list of Serverless v2

- 6. Templates -> Production
- 7. DB Cluster identifer -> database-v2
- 8. Master username -> admin, Master password & Confirm password
- 9. Instance configuration 
  = 1. Burstable classes (includes t classes) - db.t3.small
  = 2. Enable Include previous generation classes

- 10. Availability & durability
  = Create an Aurora Replica or Reader node in a different AZ

- 11. Connectivity
  = 1. Compute resource -> Don't connect to an EC2 compute resource
  = 2. Public access -> Yes
  = 3. VPC Security group (Firewall) -> Create new -> demo-database-aurora
  = 4. DB Port -> 3306

- 12. DB Authentication -> Password authentication
- 13. Monitoring -> Disabled "Enable Enhanced monitoring" button
- 14. Additional configuration
  = 1. Initial database name -> mydb
  = 2. Backup retenion period -> 1 day (Choose between 0 ~ 35 days)
  = 3. Disabled "Enable Backtrack"
  = 4. Disabled any selection of "Log exports"

- 15. Click Create database button

Amazon RDS Databases - Aurora (Optional, Make sure to click Cancel button)
- 1. Check Regional cluster, Writer instance, and Reader instance
- 2. Click database-2 and check Connectivity & security tab Endpoints
  = 1. Reader instance
  = 2. Writer instance

- 3. Actions - Create cross-Region read replica (Optional)
  = If you want to have a replica in another region

- 4. Actions - Add replica auto scaling (From database-2)
  = 1. Policy details
    -> 1. Policy name - ReadReplicasScalingPolicy
    -> 2. IAM role
    -> 3. Target metric
       => 1. Average CPU utilization of Aurora Replicas (Choose this)
       => 2. Average connections of Aurora Replicas

    -> 4. Target value - 60 %
    -> 5. Enabled Scale in

  = 2. Cluster capacity details
    -> 1. Minimum capacity - 1 Aurora Replicas
    -> 2. Maximum capacity - 15 Aurora Replicas

- 5. Actions - Add AWS Region (From database-2)
  = 1. If you chose a version of Aurora that was enabled with global database feature
  = 2. You can't add an AWS Region to this DB cluster
    -> 1. This will allow you to get a global Aurora
    -> 2. It's impossible with this cluster because we need to have an instance
       => With a compatible size to do this first

    -> 3. Needs to change to a large type of instance

Delete RDS (Aurora) instances
- 1. Select Reader instance -> Actions - Delete, Then type delete me
- 2. Select Writer instance -> Actions - Delete, Then type delete me
- 3. Select database-2 instance -> Actions - Delete, Then type delete me
