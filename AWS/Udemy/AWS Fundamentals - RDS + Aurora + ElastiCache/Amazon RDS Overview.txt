Amazon RDS Overview
- 1. RDS stands for Relational Database Service
- 2. It's a managed DB service for DB user SQL as a query language
- 3. It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
  = 1. Postgres
  = 2. MySQL
  = 3. MariaDB
  = 4. Oracle
  = 5. MS-SQL Server
  = 6. Aurora (AWS Proprietary DB)

Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2
- 1. RDS is a managed service:
  = 1. Automated provisioning, OS Patching
  = 2. Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp
    -> Point in Time Restore

  = 3. Monitoring dashboards
  = 4. Read replicas for improved read performance
  = 5. Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
  = 6. Maintenance windows for upgrades
  = 7. Scaling capability (vertical and horizontol)
  = 8. Storage backend by EBS (gp2 or io1)

- 2. But you can't SSH into your instances

RDS - Storage Auto Scaling
- 1. Helps you increase storage on your RDS DB instance
- 2. When RDS detects you are running out of free database storage, it scales automatically
  = 1. Application does a lot of read and writes to your RDS DB
  = 2. Automatically, with some threshold, then the storage can auto scale
    -> Feature of RDS

- 3. Avoid manually scaling your database stoarge
- 4. You have to set Maximum Storage Threshold - Maximum limit for DB Storage
- 5. Automatically modify storage if:
  = 1. Free storage is less than 10% of allocated storage
  = 2. Low-storage lasts at least 5 minutes
  = 3. 6 hours have passed since last modification

- 6. Useful for applications with unpredictable workloads
- 7. Supports all RDS database engines
  -> Maria DB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle
