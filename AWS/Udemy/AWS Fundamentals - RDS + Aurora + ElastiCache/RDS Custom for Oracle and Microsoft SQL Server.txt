RDS Custom
- 1. Managed Oracle and MS-SQL Server DB with OS and DB customization
- 2. RDS: Automates setup, operation, and scaling of DB in AWS
- 3. Custom: access to the underlying database and OS so you can
  = 1. Configure settings
  = 2. Install patches
  = 3. Enable native features
  = 4. Access the underlying EC2 Instance using SSH or SSM Session Manager
    -> 1. User, using Amazon RDS Custom
       => Apply customizations and SSH into it

    -> 2. EC2 Instance, Amazon RDS, Automation Mode disabled
       => 1. So that RDS does not perform any automation, or maintenance, or scaling, etc..
       => 2. It's much better to take a DB snapshot
       => 3. Otherwise you won't able to recover from your actions

- 4. De-activate Automation Mode to perform your customization
  = Better to take a DB snapshot before

- 5. RDS vs RDS Custom
  = 1. RDS: entire DB and the OS to be managed by AWS
  = 2. RDS Custom: full admin access to the underlying OS and the DB
