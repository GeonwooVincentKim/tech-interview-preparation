RDS & Aurora Security
- 1. At-rest encryption:
  = 1. DB master & replicas encryption using AWS KMS - must be defined as launch time
  = 2. If the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted
  = 3. To encrypt an un-encrypted DB, go through a DB snapshot & restore as encrypted

- 2. In-flight encryption: TLS-ready by default, use the AWS TLS root certificates client-side
  = Provided on the AWS Website

- 3. IAM Authentication: IAM roles to connect to your DB (instead of username / pw)
  = 1. If you're EC2 instances had IAM roles, they can authenticate to your DB directly using that
  = 2. Not a username and a password -> Helps you manage all the security within AWS and IAM

- 4. Security Groups: Control Network access to your RDS / Aurora DB
- 5. No SSH available except on RDS Custom
- 6. Audit Logs can be enabled and sent to CloudWatch Logs for longer retention
