Hands-On: Launching an EC2 Instance running Linux
- 1. We'll be launching our first virual server using the AWS Console
- 2. We'll get first high-level approach to the various parameters
- 3. We'll see that our web server is launched using EC2 user data
- 4. We'll learn how to start / stop / terminate our instance.

EC2 Launch an instance
- 1. Name and tags
- 2. Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)
  = 1. Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
    -> Choose Free tier eligible instance before you launch instance

  = 2. Architecture
    -> 64-bit (x86)

- 3. Instance type
  = t2.micro - Free tier eligible

- 4. Key pair (login)
  = 1. SSH Utility to access own instance
  = 2. Key pair name - required
  = 3. Create Key pair
    -> 1. Key pair name
    -> 2. Key pair type
       => 1. RSA - Encrpyted private and public key pair
       => 2. ED25519 - Encrypted private and public key pair (Not supported for Windows Instances)

    -> 3. Private Key file format
       => 1. .pem - For use with OpenSSH, Mac or Linux or Above than Windows 10 (Windows 10, 11)
       => 2. .ppk - For use with PuTTY, Less than Windows 10 (Windows 8, 7)

- 5. Network Settings
  = 1. Network
  = 2. Subnet
  = 3. Auto-assign public IP
  = 4. Firewall (security groups)
    -> 1. Control the traffic from and to our instance, and therefore we can add rules
    -> 2. First security group called 'launch-wizard-1'
       => 1. Allow SSH Traffic from - Helps you connect to your instance
       => 2. Allow HTTPS Traffic from the internet
          -- To set up an endpoint, for example when creating a web server

       => 3. Allow HTTP Traffic from the internet
	  -- 1. To set up an endpoint, for example when creating a web server
	  -- 2. To launch the local web-server, it needs this

    -> 3. Security Group
       => 1. Create security group
       => 2. Select existing security group

- 6. Configure storage
