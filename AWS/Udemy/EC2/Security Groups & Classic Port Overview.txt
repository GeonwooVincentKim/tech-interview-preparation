Introduction to Security Groups
- 1. Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
- 2. They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.
  = 1. Create Security Group around EC2 Instance that is the firewall that is around it
  = 2. This security group is going to have rules
    -> 1. Inbound traffic from the outside into the EC2 instance is allowed (www -> EC2 Instance)
    -> 2. EC2 Instance can perform some outbound traffic (EC2 Instance -> www)
    -> 3. To talk from where it is into the internet

- 3. Security Groups only contain allow rules.
- 4. Security Groups rules can reference by IP or by security group

Security Groups Deeper Dive
- 1. Security Groups are acting as a 'firewall' on EC2 Instances
- 2. They regulate:
  = 1. Access to Ports
  = 2. Authorised IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
  = 3. Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
  = 4. Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

Security Groups Diagram
- 1. Example
  = 1. EC2 Instance IP XX.XX.XX.XX
  = 2. Security Group 1 Inbound Filter IP / Port with Rules
  = 3. Security Group 1 Outbound Filter IP / Port with Rules

- 2. Your Computer - IP XX.XX.XX.XX (Authorised port 22)
  = Traffic can go through from our computer to the EC2 Instance

- 3. Other Computer (not authorised port 22)
  = Won't get through the Security Group because the firewall is going to block it, and timeout

- 4. WWW Any IP - Any Port
  = Try to access a website and initiate a connection, going to allowed by the security group

Security Groups Good to know
- 1. Can be attached to multiple instances
- 2. Locked down to a region / VPC combination
- 3. Does live "outside" the EC2 - if traffic blocked the EC2 Instance won't see it
  = Not like an application running on EC2

- 4. It's good to maintain one seperate security group for SSH access
- 5. If your application is not accessible (time out), then it's a security group issue
- 6. If your application gives a "connection refused" error, then it's an application error or it's not launched

  = 1. Get a response and connection refused, then the security group actually worked
  = 2. The traffic went through and the application was errored
  = 3. It wasn't launched or something like this

- 7. All inbound traffic is blocked by default
- 8. All outbound traffic is authorised by default

Referencing other security groups Diagram
- 1. EC2 Instance (IP XX.XX.XX.XX)
- 2. Security Group 1 Inbound
  = 1. Authorising Security Group 1
  = 2. Authorising Security Group 2

- 3. Security Group 2 (attached) & EC2 Instance (IP XX.XX.XX.XX)
- 4. Allow our EC2 Instance to go connect straight through on the port we decided onto our first EC2 instances

- 5. Security Group 1 (attached) & EC2 Instance (IP XX.XX.XX.XX)
  = 1. To communicate straight back to our instances
  = 2. Regardless of the IP of our EC2 Instances
    -> 1. Because they have the right security group attached to them
    -> 2. They're able to communicate straight through to other instances

- 6. Security Group 3 (attached) & EC2 Instance (IP XX.XX.XX.XX)
  = UnAuthroized in the inbound rules, being denied and things don't work

Classic Ports to know
- 1. 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linxu instance
- 2. 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - upload files into a file share
- 3. 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - upload files using SSH
- 4. 80 = HTTP - access unsecured websites
- 5. 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a Windows instance
