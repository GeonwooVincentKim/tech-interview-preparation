Amazon EC2
- 1. EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS offering
- 2. EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
- 3. It mainly consists in the capability of:
  = 1. Renting virtual machines (EC2)
  = 2. Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
  = 3. Distributing load across machines (ELB)
  = 4. Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

- 4. Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

EC2 Sizing & configuration options
- 1. Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS
- 2. How much compute power & cores (CPU)
- 3. How much random-acess memory (RAM)
- 4. How much storage space:
  = 1. Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
  = 2. Hardware (EC2 Instance Store)

- 5. Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
- 6. Firewall rules: security group
- 7. Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

EC2 User Data
- 1. It's possible to bootstrap out instances using an EC2 User Data script
- 2. BootStrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
- 3. That script is only run once at the instance first start
- 4. EC2 user data is used to automate book tasks such as:
  = 1. Installing updates
  = 2. Installing software
  = 3. Downloading common files from the internet
  = 4. Anything you can think of (Whatever you want)

- 5. The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user

EC2 Instance types: example
- 1. Instance -> t2.micro, t2.large, c5d.4xlarge, r5.16xlarge, m5.8xlarge
- 2. vCPU (cores) -> 1, 4, 16, 64, 32
- 3. Mem (GiB) -> 1, 16, 32, 512, 128
- 4. Storage -> EBS Only, EBS Only, 1 x 400 NVMe SSD, EBS Only, EBS Only
- 5. Network Performance -> Low to moderate, Moderate, Up to 10 Gbps, 20 Gbps, 10 Gbps
- 6. EBS Bandwidth (Mbps) -> X, X, 4750, 13600, 6800

- 7. t2.micro is part of the AWS free tier (up to 750 hours per month)
