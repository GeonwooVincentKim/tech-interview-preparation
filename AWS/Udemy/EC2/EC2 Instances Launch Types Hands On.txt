    -> 2. Go to the `Create Spot Fleet Request` page
       => 1. Manually configure launch parameters
          -- Select an AMI and configure options parameters

       => 2. Use a launch template
          -- Use a launch template to quickly set instance launch parameters

    -> 3. Target capacity
       => 1. Set as 10 vCPUs
       => 2. instances - vCPUs - Memory (MiB - RAM)
       => 3. Check `Maintain Target Capacity`
          -- 1. Set `Interruption behavior` as 'Terminate'
             (Can select Terminate, Stop, or Hibernate)

    -> 4. Instance type requirements
       => 1. Specify instances attributes that match your compute requirements
          -- Required instance attributes (vCPUs, Memory (GiB), Additional Instance attribute)
       
       => 2. Manually select instance types
       
    -> 5. Allocation strategy
       => Spot allocation strategy
