Section introduction
- 1. Amazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS
- 2. It's advertised as "infinitely scaling" storage
- 3. Many websites use Amazon S3 as a backbone
- 4. Many AWS services use Amazon S3 as an integration as well
- 5. We'll have a step-by-step approach to S3

Amazon S3 Use cases
- 1. Backup and storage
- 2. Disaster Recovery
- 3. Archive
- 4. Hybrid Cloud storage
- 5. Application hosting
- 6. Media hosting
- 7. Data lakes & big data analytics
- 8. Software delivery
- 9. Static website
- 10. Company
  = 1. Nasdaq - stores 7 years of data intoS3 Glacier
  = 2. Sysco - runs analytics on its data and gain business insights

Amazon S3 - Buckets
- 1. Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories)
- 2. Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
- 3. Buckets are defined at the region level
- 4. S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
- 5. Naming convention
  = 1. No uppercase, No underscore
  = 2. 3 ~ 63 characters long
  = 3. Not an IP
  = 4. Must start with lowercase letter or number
  = 5. Must NOT start with the prefix xn--
  = 6. Must NOT end with the suffix -s3alias

Amazon S3 - Objects
- 1. Objects (files) have a Key
- 2. The key is the FULL path:
  = 1. s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt -> S3 Bucket with Objects
  = 2. s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt

- 3. The key is composed of prefix + object name
  <Decomposed path before>
  = s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt

- 4. There's no concept of "directories" within buckets
  = Although the UI will trick you to think otherwise

- 5. Just keys with very long names that contain slashes ("/")

Amazon S3 - Objects (cont.)
- 1. Object values are the content of the body:
  = 1. Max. Object Size is 5 TB (5000 GB)
  = 3. If uploading more than 5 GB, must the "multi-part upload"

- 2. Metadata (list of text key / value pairs - system or user metadata)
- 3. Tags (Unicode key / value pair - up to 10) - useful for security / lifecycle
- 4. Version ID (if versioning is enabled)
