Amazon S3 - Security
- 1. User-Based
  = IAM Policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM

- 2. Resource-Based
  = 1. Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
  = 2. Object Access Control List (ACL) - finer grain (can be disabled)
  = 3. Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - less common (can be disabled)

- 3. Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
  = 1. The user IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
  = 2. AND there's no explicit DENY

- 4. Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys

S3 Bucket Policies
- 1. JSON based policies
  = 1. Resources: buckets and objects
  = 2. Effect: Allow / Deny
  = 3. Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny
  = 4. Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to

- 2. Use S3 bucket for policy to:
  = 1. Grant public access to the bucket
  = 2. Force objects to be encrypted at upload
  = 3. Grant access to another account (Cross Account)

- 3. Example
  {
    "Version: "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
	"Sid": "PublicRead",
	"Effect": "Allow",
	"Principal": "*",
	"Action": [
	  "s3:GetObject"
	],
	"Resource": [
	  "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*"  --> /*: Allow objects
	]
      }
    ]
  }

Example: Public Access - Use Bucket Policy
- 1. Anonymous www website visitor
  = Attach to S3 Bucket

- 2. S3 Bucket Policy Allows Public Access
- 3. S3 Bucket

Example: User Access to S3 - IAM permissions
- 1. IAM Policy
- 2. IAM User
  = 1. If the user wants to access to S3, assign IAM Permissions to that user through the IAM Policy
  = 2. Policy allows access to S3 Bucket

- 3. S3 Bucket
