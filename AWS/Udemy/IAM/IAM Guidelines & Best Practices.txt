IAM Guidelines & Best Practices
- 1. Do not use the root account except for AWS account setup
  = You should have two accounts, a root account and your own personal accounts

- 2. One physical user = One AWS User
  = 1. Do not give to your friends who want to use AWS your credentials
  = 2. Instead, create another user for them

- 3. Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
- 4. Create a strong password policy
- 5. Use and enforce the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
  = Really guarantee that your account is going to be safe or safter from hackers

- 6. Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS Services
  = Includes easy two instances which are virtual servers

- 7. Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI / SDK)
  = When user use AWS programmatically or using the CLI
    -> 1. Must generate access keys
    -> 2. These access keys are just like passwords, they're very secret

- 8. Audit permissions of your account using IAM Credentials Report & IAM Access Advisor
- 9. Never share IAM users & Access Keys
