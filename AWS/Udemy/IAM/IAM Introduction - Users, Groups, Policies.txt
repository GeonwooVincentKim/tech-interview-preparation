IAM Users & Groups
- 1. IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global service
- 2. Root account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
- 3. Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
  = Example
    -> Group Developers
       => Alice, Bob, Charles

    -> Group Operations
       => David, Edward

    -> Group Audit Team (Third Group - Possible Configurations for IAM)
       => Charles, David

- 4. Groups only contain users, not other groups
- 5. Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

IAM Permissions
- 1. Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
- 2. These policies define the permissions of the users
- 3. In AWS you apply the least privilege principle
  = 1. Don't give more permissions than a user needs
  = 2. If a user just needs access to three services, just create a permission for that user
