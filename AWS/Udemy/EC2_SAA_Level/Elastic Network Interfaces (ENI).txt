Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)
- 1. Logical component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card
  = Availability Zone
    -> One EC2 Instance (group 1), attached on Eth0, primary ENI, EC2 Instance network connectivity
       => Private IP

- 2. The ENI can have the following attributes:
  = 1. Primary private IPv4, one or more secondary IPv4
  = 2. Availability Zone
    -> One EC2 Instance (group 1), Eth1, secondary ENI

  = 3. One Elastic IP (IPv4) per private IPv4
    -> One            Public IPv4

  = 4. One or more security groups
  = 5. A MAC Address

- 3. Create ENI independently, attach them on the fly (move them) on EC2 Instances for failover
- 4. Bound to a specific availability zone (AZ)
  = 1. Instance and it has another ENI attached to it
  = 2. Can move Eth1 from the first EC2 Instance -> second EC2 Instance to move that private IP
  = 3. Private IP will change from the first issue to instance	
    -> Will be attached to the second EC2 Instance (helpful for failovers)

  = 4. Easy to instance is accessed by a private static IP
    -> You can move the IP around between these two instances for failover purposes
