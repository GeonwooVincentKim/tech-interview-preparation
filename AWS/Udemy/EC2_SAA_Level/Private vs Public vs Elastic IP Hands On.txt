Private vs Public vs Elastic IP Hands On
- 1. Private IPv4 addresses are belong to a private network, so it cannot connected
- 2. Public IP allows you to access AWS from a public network
  = Therefore the public network being the internet

- 3. Check Public IPv4 addresses change
  = Stop and Start the instance to observe the behavior of the public IPv4 changing

- 4. Don't want to public IPv4 change
  = Use an Elastic IP

Elastic IP addresses
- 1. Allocate Elastic IP address
  = Elastic IP address settings
    -> Public IPv4 address pool - Amazon's pool of IPv4 addresses

- 2. Allocated IPv4 address
  = 1. Can be allocated to a specific EC2 Instance
  = 2. Keep the Elastic IP as long as it's attached
  = 3. Elastic IP addresses, are charged as long as you don't use them

- 3. Associate Elastic IP address
  = 1. Actions -> Associate Elastic IP address
  = 2. Resource type
    -> Instance, Network interface

  = 3. Instance
  = 4. Private IP address
    -> To associate the Elastic IP address

  = 5. Reassociation (Option)
    -> Allow this Elastic IP address to be reassociated
