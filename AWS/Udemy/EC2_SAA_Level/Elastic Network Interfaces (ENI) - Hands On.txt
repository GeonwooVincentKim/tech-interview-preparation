Network Interfaces
- 1. Instance ID (Scroll to the right side)
- 2. Create network interface
  = 1. Description - optional
  = 2. Subnet
    -> 1. Check "Instances" `Avilability Zone` in 'Instances' page
    -> 2. Select the 'Subnet' what you've check in 'Instances' page and apply to this field
       => ex) Avilability Zone: ap-northeast-2c = Create network interface subnet = Avilability Zone

  = 3. private IPv4 address
    -> Auto-assign, Custom (Input customized IPv4 address)

  = 4. Security groups
    -> 1. Check "Instances" `Security Groups` in 'Instances' page
    -> 2. Select the 'Security Groups' in your instance and apply to this field (Checkbox)

- 3. Attach and Detach Network interfaces
  <Attach>
  = 1. Select the Network interfaces which instance Status equals to 'Available'
  = 2. Click 'Actions' and 'Attach'
    -> Attach network interface

  = 3. Go to 'Instances' page and select the Running instance
  = 4. Click 'Networking' tab and go to Network Interfaces, then check `Interface ID`
    -> 1. DemoENI gives us a secondary, but the other one gives us a Public IPv4 address
       => 1. ENI we have control over, so we could take it
       => 2. Move it from one EC2 Instance to another imagining that the two EC2 Instance

    -> 2. Can do a very quick and easy network failover between the two instances by moving an ENI

  <Detach>
  = 1. Select the Network interface which instance Description named `DemoENI`
  = 2. Click 'Actions' and 'Detach'
    -> Detach network interface

  = 3. Check in the Network Interfaces page
    -> Check the `Status` Available and `Public IPv4 address` not exist in the DemoENI instance

- 4. Solving "The network interface at device index 0 and networkCard index 0 cannot be detached."
  = 1. Network Interfaces
    -> 1. Set each 'Network interface ID' and move to it
    -> 2. Click 'Actions' and 'Change termination behavior'
    -> 3. Check 'Enable' button and save it

  = 2. Instances
    -> 1. Stop Instances
    -> 2. Terminate Instances
       => 1. If Instances are terminate, all of Network interfaces also delete in the same time
       => 2. Create manually ENI is going to stay
       => 3. Created alongside the instances are going to be automatically deleted
