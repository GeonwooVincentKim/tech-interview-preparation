What's an EBS Volume?
- 1. An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run

  = We've been using then without even knowing in this EC2 Class

- 2. It allows you instances to persist data, even after the instance is terminated
  = Recreate an instance and mount to the same EBS Volume from before and we'll get back our data

- 3. They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level)
  = CCP (Certified Cloud Parcitioner)
    -> 1. one EBS can be only mounted to one EC2 instance Associate Level
       => Solutions Architect, Developers, SysOps)

    -> 2. "multi-attach" feature for some EBS

- 4. They are bound to a specific availability zone
  = Cannot have an EBS Volume in created

- 5. How do you might think of EBS Volume?
  = 1. Analogy: Think of them as a "network USB stick"
  = 2. USB Stick that you can take from a computer and put it in another computer
    (attached through the network)

- 6. Free tier: 30 GB of free EBS Storage of type General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic per month

EBS Volume
- 1. It's a network drive (i.e. not a physical drive)
  = 1. It uses the network to communicate the instance
  = 2. There might be a bit of latency from one computer to reach to annother server
  = 3. It can be detached from an EC2 Instance and attached to another one quickly

- 2. It's locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
  = 1. An EBS Volume in us-east-1a cannot be attached to us-east-1b
  = 2. To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it

- 3. Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)
  = 1. How many GBs you want in advance and the IOPS
    -> I/O operations per seconds, your EBS Volume to perform

  = 2. You get billed for all the provisioned capacity
  = 3. You can increase the capacity of the drive over time
    -> To have better performance or more size

EBS Volume - Example
- 1. US-EAST-1A
  = 1. One EC2 Instance
  = 2. One EBS Volume (10 GB) attached to the EC2 Instance
    -> If Created new EC2 instnace, EBS Volume (100 GB) cannot be attached to two instances
       => New EC2 Instance needs to have its own EBS Volume (50 GB) attached to it
  
  = 3. Possible for having two EBS Volumes (100GB, 50GB) attached to one EC2 instance
    -> 1. Certified Cloud Practitioner Level
    -> 2. EBS Volumes are linked to an availability zone

- 2. US-EAST-1B
  = 1. To have other EBS Volumes (50 GB) in an other AZ
    -> Need to create this separately in the other availability zone

  = 2. Possible to create EBS Volumes (10 GB), and leave them unattached
  = 3. ECG instance, they can be attached on demand, makes it very powerful

EBS - Delete on Termination attribute
- 1. Delete on Termination
  = 1. Ticked for the Root Volume
  = 2. Not ticked for a new EBS Volume

- 2. Controls the EBS behaviour when an EC2 instance terminates
  = 1. By default, the root EBS volume is deleted (attribute enabled)
    (Alongside the instance being terminated)

  = 2. By default, any other attached EBS volume is not deleted (attribute disabled)
    -> Disabled by default

- 3. This can be controlled by the AWS console / AWS CLI
  = Can control it if you want to enable or disabled delete on termination

- 4. Use case: preserve root volume when instance is terminated
