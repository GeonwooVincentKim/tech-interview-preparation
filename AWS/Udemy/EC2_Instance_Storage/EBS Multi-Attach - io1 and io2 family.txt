EBS Multi-Attach - io1/io2 family
- 1. Attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ (Availability Zone)
  = Availability Zone 1
    -> 1. Multiple EC2 instances and an io2 volume with Multi-Attach feature enabled
    -> 2. Then io2 volume can be attached to multiple EC2 instances at a time
       => Something that is only available for the io1 and io2 family of EBS volumes

- 2. Each instance has full read & write permissions to the high-performance volume
  = Each instance can all Write and Read at the same time

- 3. Use case:
  = 1. Achieve higher application availability in clustered Linux applications (ex: Teradata)
  = 2. Applications must manage concurrent write operations
    -> 1. Multi-Attach feature is only available from within a specified availability zone
    -> 2. It doesn't allow you to attach an EBS volume from one AZ to another AZ

- 4. Another limitation of Multi-Attach
  = Up to 16 EC2 Instances at a time
    -> Can be attaching the same volume

- 5. Must use a file system that's cluster-aware (not XFS, EXT4, etc...)
  = It's a different file system than XFS or EX4
