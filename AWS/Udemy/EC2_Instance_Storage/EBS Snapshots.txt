EBS Snapshots
- 1. Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
- 2. Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
- 3. Can copy snapshots across AZ or Region
  = Copy these EBS Snapshots across differetn Availability Zones or even across different Region

- 4. Example
  = 1. EC2 instance + EBS volume (50 GB) in US-EAST-1A
    -> Take a snapshot of the EBS volume

  = 2. EC2 instance in US-EAST-1B
    -> Restore EBS (50 GB) Snapshot in another AZ (to the US-EAST-1B)

EBS Snapshots Features
- 1. EBS Snapshot Archive
  = 1. Move a Snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper
    -> EBS Snapshot - archive - EBS Snapshot Archive

  = 2. Takes within 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive

- 2. Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots
  = 1. Setup rules to retain deleted snsapshots so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
    -> 1. Instead of being permanently deleted
    -> 2. EBS Snapshot - delete - Recycle Bin

  = 2. Specify retention (from | day to | year)

- 3. Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
  = Force full initialization of snapshot to have no latency on the first use ($$$)
