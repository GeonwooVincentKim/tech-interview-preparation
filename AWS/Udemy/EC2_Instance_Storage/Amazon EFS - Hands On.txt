Amazon EFS - Hands On
- 1. Create file system
  = 1. Customize
  = 2. File system settings
    -> 1. Regional (Standard) NFS file system
       => Stored data redundantly (replicated) across multiple AZs 

    -> 2. One Zone NFS file system
       => 1. Stored data redundantly within a single AZ
          -- You need to have for production, just testing EFS out

       => 2. AZ down, EFS file system is down, choose the AZ

    -> 3. Check Enable automatic backups
    -> 4. Lifecycle management
       => 1. Cost savings
       => 2. Object aren't being used very often, then transition them into different access tier
	  -- Standard-Infrequent Access Storage class

       => 3. File hasn't been accessed for 30 days, then Transition it into IA
       => 4. Transition it out of IA on first access or never as you want
  
  = 3. Performance settings
    -> 1. performance mode
       => 1. General Purpose (Recommended) - Helpful for latency-sensitive applications
       => 2. Max I/O - Highly paralleized workloads can tolerate higher latencies

    -> 2. Throughput mode
       => 1. Enhanced - Throughput levels for workloads with a range of performance requirements
	  -- 1. Elastic (Recommended) - Mode for workloads with unpredictable I/O
	  -- 2. Provisioned - Mode if you can estimate your workload's throughput requirements

       => 2. Bursting - Allows you select Max I/O, scales with the amount of storage for workloads
