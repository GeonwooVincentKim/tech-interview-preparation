EC2 Instance Store
- 1. EBS Volumes are network drives with good but "limited" performance
- 2. If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store
  = 1. EC2 Instance is a virtual machine, but is obviously attached to a real hardware server
  = 2. Some of these servers do have disk space that is attached directly to the Physical connection
  = 3. Special type of EC2 Instance can leverage something called an EC2 Instance Store
    -> Hard drive attached to the physical server

- 3. Better I/O Performance
- 4. EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they're stopped (ephemeral)
  -> 1. Caveat is that if you stop or you terminate your EC2 instance, that has an Instance Store
     => Then the storage will be lost

  -> 2. Ephemeral Storage
     => EC2 Instance Store can now be used as a durable long term place to store your data

- 5. Good for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content
- 6. Risk of data loss if hardware fails
- 7. Backups and Replication are your responsibility

Local EC2 Instance Store
- 1. Instance Store attached to these kind of instances
- 2. Read IOPS and the Write IOPS which correspond to how many I/O operations, we can do per second.
- 3. Check 100% Random Read IOPS and Write IOPS in Local EC2 Instance Store page
  = Ex) With an EBS volume of type BP2 for example, Can reach 32,000 IOPS

- 4. Think local EC2 Instance Store
