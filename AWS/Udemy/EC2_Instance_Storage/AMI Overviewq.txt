AMI Overview
- 1. AMI = Amazon Machine Image
- 2. AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
  = 1. You add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring...
  = 2. Faster boot / configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged

- 3. AMI are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)
- 4. You can launch EC2 instances from:
  = 1. A Public AMI: AWS Provided
  = 2. Your own AMI: you make and maintain them yourself
  = 3. An AWS Marketplace AMI: an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)
    -> Made by someone else, potentially sold by someone else

  = 4. Quite common to have vendoers on AWS to create their own AMIs on their own Software

AMI Process (from an EC2 Instance)
- 1. Start an EC2 Instance and customize it
- 2. Stop the instance (for data integrity)
- 3. Build an AMI - this will also create EBS snapshots
- 4. Launch instances from other AMIs
  = 1. Instance US-EAST-1A and launching EC2 instance
    -> 1. Create AMI (Custom AMI) from US-EAST-1A
    -> 2. Launch from AMI to US-EAST-1B

  = 2. Instance US-EAST-1B
