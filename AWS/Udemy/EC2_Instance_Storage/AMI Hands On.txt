- 2. Copy 'ec2-user-data.sh' file and paste into User-data field

  = 3. Click 'Launch instance from AMI' when it status is Available
    -> Or click 'Launch an instance'

  = 3. Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)
    -> 1. Go 'My AMIs' tap and select 'Owned by me' + Key pair + Network settings (existing)
    -> 2. Copy 'ec2-user-data.sh' file and paste into User-data field
    -> 3. Make sure copy only 1 ~ 3rd line and the last line (starting from echo)
