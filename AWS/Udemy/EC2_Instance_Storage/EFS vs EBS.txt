EFS vs EBS - Elastic Block Storage
- 1. EBS volumes...
  = 1. one instance (except multi-attach io1/io2)
  = 2. are locked at the Availability Zone (AZ) level
    -> 1. One EC2 in AZ1, One EBS Volume attached to it
    -> 2. It cannot be attached to an ec2 instance in AZ2

  = 3. gp2: IO increases if the disk size increases
  = 4. io1: Can increase IO independently


- 2. To migrate an EBS volume across AZ
  = 1. Take a snapshot (EBS Snapshot)
    -> 1. One EC2 in AZ1 and an EBS volume migrating take a EBS Snapshot
    -> 2. AZ1 (One EC2 + EBS) -> snapshot -> EBS Snapshot

  = 2. Restore the snapshot (EBS Snapshot) to another AZ
  = 3. EBS Backups use IO and you shouldn't run them
    -> 1. While your application is handling a lot of traffic
    -> 2. EBS Snapshot -> restore -> AZ2 (EBS)

- 3. Root EBS Volumes of instances get terminated by default if the EC2 instance gets terminated
  = You can disable that behavior

EBS vs EFS - Elastic File System
- 1. Mounting 100s of instances across AZ
- 2. Example
  = 1. AZ1 with One EFS file system can have different mount targets in different AZs
  = 2. And then multiple instances can share that one file system together
  = 3. AZ1 (One EFS file system <-> EFS Mount Target) <-> EFS
  = 4. AZ2 (One EFS file system <-> EFS Mount Target) <-> EFS

- 3. EFS share website files (WordPress)
- 4. Only for Linux Instances (POSIX)
- 5. EFS has a higher price point than EBS
- 6. Can leverage EFS-IA for cost savings
- 7. Remember: EFS vs EBS vs Instance Store
  = 1. Instance Store: Physically attached to the EC2 instance
  = 2. If you lose your EC2 instance you will lose the storage as well
